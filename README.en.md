### Description

This is a Python application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows you to convert web pages to PDF files. The application uses the PyQt5 library for creating the interface and Selenium with ChromeDriver to load web pages and save them as PDFs.

### Features

*   **URL to PDF Conversion:** Enter the URL of a web page and choose a path to save the PDF file.
*   **Conversion Progress:** A progress bar shows the status of the conversion process.
*   **Error Handling:** Error messages are displayed in dialog boxes.
*   **Asynchronous Operation:** Conversion is performed in a separate thread, which does not block the application interface.

### Requirements

Before running the application, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

*   **PyQt5:** For creating the graphical user interface.
    ```bash
    pip install PyQt5
    ```
*   **Selenium:** For controlling the Chrome browser.
    ```bash
    pip install selenium
    ```
*   **webdriver-manager:** For automatically installing ChromeDriver.
    ```bash
    pip install webdriver-manager
    ```

You must also have **Google Chrome** browser installed, as the application uses ChromeDriver to render web pages.

### How to Use

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Execute the `pip install` commands listed above to install the necessary libraries.
2.  **Run the Script:** Save the Python code to a file, for example, `url_to_pdf.py`, and run it from the command line:
    ```bash
    python url_to_pdf.py
    ```
3.  **Using the GUI:**
    *   In the **URL** field: enter the URL of the web page you want to convert to PDF.
    *   In the **Save as** field: specify the path and filename to save the PDF, or click the **Browse** button to select a path through a dialog box.
    *   Click the **Convert to PDF** button to start the conversion process.
    *   The progress bar will show the conversion status.
    *   Upon completion, you will see a success or error message.

### Notes

*   The application uses Chrome's headless mode for conversion, so the Chrome browser will not be visible on the screen during operation.
*   A stable internet connection is required for the application to work correctly to load web pages.
*   The first run may take slightly longer as ChromeDriver will be downloaded automatically.

### Future Development Plans

In the future, we plan to expand the functionality of this application to make converting web pages to PDF even **higher quality and more user-friendly**. Here are some of the key development directions:

*   **Improved HTML Parsing:** Enhancing HTML code processing for **more accurate conversion of complex web pages**. This will allow for better handling of diverse website structures and ensure that PDF files **closely match the original**.

*   **CSS Style Support:** Implementing CSS processing to **preserve the visual appearance of web pages in PDFs**. This will provide **more accurate reproduction of layouts, fonts, colors, and other styles**, making PDF documents **more attractive and informative**.

*   **Advanced Layout Rendering:** Developing a more powerful layout engine for **correctly handling various web page elements**, including block and inline elements. Special attention will be paid to **improving pagination**, so that long pages are correctly divided in the PDF, ensuring **readability**.

*   **PDF Generation Optimization:** Improving the PDF file creation process to **enhance quality and reduce the size** of the final documents. We plan to implement **cross-reference support** for navigation within the PDF and add a **trailer** for compliance with PDF standards.

These improvements are aimed at making the URL to PDF converter an even **more powerful, accurate, and convenient tool** for users. **Stay tuned for updates!**
